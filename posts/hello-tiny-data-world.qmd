This is my very first tiny data story.

Right now, the goal is just to make sure everything works: the blog, the code, and the render.  
So here's a microscopic dataset to launch this thing.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "fruit": ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"],
    "rating": [8, 6, 9]
})
df
```
